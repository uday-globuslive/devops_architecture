# DevSecOps Case Study: Healthcare Information System Transformation

## Organization Overview

A large healthcare provider network serving over 5 million patients across 30 hospitals and 200+ clinics underwent a digital transformation initiative to modernize their patient care applications while ensuring strict compliance with healthcare regulations. The organization manages sensitive patient data (PHI) and must adhere to HIPAA, HITECH, and various state-level healthcare privacy regulations.

## Key Terms and Concepts

### PHI (Protected Health Information)
**PHI** refers to individually identifiable health information that is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or its business associates.

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
**HIPAA** is a US law designed to provide privacy standards to protect patients' medical records and other health information, setting limits on who can access and receive PHI.

### HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act
The **HITECH Act** expanded HIPAA requirements to strengthen the protection of PHI, increase penalties for HIPAA violations, and provide incentives for the adoption of electronic health records.

### DevSecOps
**DevSecOps** is an approach that integrates security practices into DevOps processes, making security a shared responsibility throughout the software development lifecycle.

### Secure SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)
A **Secure SDLC** integrates security testing and activities into each phase of the software development process rather than treating it as a separate phase.

### Compliance as Code
**Compliance as Code** is the process of codifying compliance requirements into automated tests and policies that can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
**SAST** tools analyze source code for potential security vulnerabilities without executing the code.

### DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
**DAST** tools test running applications by simulating attacks to identify vulnerabilities that might be exploited by attackers.

### SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
**SCA** tools identify and analyze open-source components in an application to identify security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues.

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
**IaC** is the management of infrastructure through code instead of manual processes, using configuration files to automate infrastructure provisioning.

### WAF (Web Application Firewall)
A **WAF** protects web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet, blocking attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

### RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection)
**RASP** is a security technology integrated into an application's runtime environment that can detect and block attacks in real-time.

### SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
**SIEM** systems collect, analyze, and correlate security event information from various sources to identify potential security threats.

### Data Masking
**Data Masking** is the process of hiding original sensitive data with modified content while maintaining the data's format and usability for non-production environments.
