## Usage

These architectures are designed to be reference implementations and can be customized for specific requirements. Each document can be used as:

- A starting point for new projects
- A reference for modernizing existing systems
- A training resource for teams
- A guide for implementing specific DevOps practices

## Common Tools

Tools featured across these architectures include:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Pulumi, Bicep, ARM Templates
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes, AKS, EKS, GKE
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, Jenkins, ArgoCD, FluxCD
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Azure Monitor, Application Insights
- **Security**: HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, OPA, Trivy, SonarQube
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd, Consul
- **Data Processing**: Azure Synapse, Databricks, Stream Analytics, Event Hubs

## Recommended Implementation Approach

1. Start with understanding your specific requirements
2. Select the architecture that best matches your needs
3. Customize the components based on your environment
4. Implement incrementally using the provided patterns
5. Establish observability early in the process
6. Build automated testing and validation
7. Document modifications and decisions

## Infrastructure as Code Best Practices

When implementing these architectures with Terraform, Bicep, or other IaC tools:

1. Use remote state storage with locking
2. Structure code with reusable modules
3. Pin provider and module versions
4. Implement proper state separation by environment
5. Use consistent naming conventions and tagging
6. Integrate automated testing and validation
7. Follow least privilege principle for service principals
8. Implement CI/CD for infrastructure changes
