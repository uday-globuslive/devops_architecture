## Key Terms and Concepts

### DevSecOps
**DevSecOps** is an approach that integrates security practices within the DevOps methodology, making security a shared responsibility throughout the entire IT lifecycle.

### Shift Left Security
**Shift Left Security** refers to moving security considerations earlier in the development process, rather than addressing them only at the end.

### CI/CD Pipeline
**CI/CD Pipeline** (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) is an automated software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for deployment.

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
**SAST** analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities without executing the application by examining code for patterns that indicate security weaknesses.

### DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
**DAST** tests running applications by simulating attacks against an application to identify vulnerabilities that might be exploited.

### SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
**SCA** identifies and analyzes open-source components in an application to identify security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues.

### IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing)
**IAST** combines elements of SAST and DAST by monitoring applications during testing to identify vulnerabilities with greater accuracy.

### WAF (Web Application Firewall)
A **WAF** protects web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet, blocking attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

### RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection)
**RASP** is a security technology integrated into an application's runtime environment that can detect and block attacks in real-time.

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
**IaC** is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.

### CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)
**CSPM** continuously monitors cloud infrastructure configurations to identify compliance issues, security risks, and misconfigurations.

### PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
**PCI-DSS** is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
**GDPR** is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy that addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas.

### Security Champion
A **Security Champion** is a developer with an interest in security who helps promote secure development practices within their team, acting as a liaison between security and development teams.
