## Key Terms and Concepts

### Azure Landing Zone
A **Landing Zone** is a pre-configured, secure, scalable environment in Azure that serves as a foundation for hosting your workloads and applications. It implements best practices for security, operations, and governance to accelerate cloud adoption.

### Azure Tenant
The **Azure Tenant** is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that represents an organization. It's the security boundary for your organization in Azure.

### Subscription
An **Azure Subscription** is a logical container for your resources and represents an agreement with Microsoft to use Azure services. Subscriptions help organize resources, manage billing, and control access.

### Resource Group
A **Resource Group** is a logical container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. It allows you to manage and organize resources as a single unit.

### Management Group
**Management Groups** provide a governance scope above subscriptions, allowing you to organize subscriptions into hierarchies for unified policy and access management.

### Hub-Spoke Network Topology
The **Hub-Spoke** model is a network architecture where a central hub virtual network connects to multiple spoke virtual networks. The hub contains shared services like firewalls, while spokes contain workload-specific resources.

### Azure Policy
**Azure Policy** is a service that evaluates your resources for non-compliance with defined rules. Policies can enforce standards, security requirements, and regulatory compliance.

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
**RBAC** provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources, allowing you to control who has access to specific resources and what actions they can perform.

### Managed Identity
**Managed Identities** eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials by providing Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD.

### Azure Blueprints
**Azure Blueprints** enable you to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to standards, patterns, and requirements.

### Terraform
**Terraform** is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

### State File
A Terraform **State File** stores the current state of your infrastructure, allowing Terraform to map real-world resources to your configuration and track metadata.

### Module
A Terraform **Module** is a reusable, self-contained package of Terraform configurations that manages a specific set of resources in a consistent way.

### Terraform Provider
A Terraform **Provider** is a plugin that interacts with APIs of a specific service, such as Azure, and exposes resources that can be managed.

### Azure Private Link
**Azure Private Link** provides private connectivity from a virtual network to Azure PaaS services, customer-owned services, or Microsoft partner services.

### Azure Bastion
**Azure Bastion** is a fully managed PaaS service that provides secure RDP and SSH access to virtual machines without exposing public IP addresses.

### ExpressRoute
**ExpressRoute** provides a private connection between your on-premises infrastructure and Microsoft cloud services, bypassing the public internet for enhanced security and performance.

### Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
**PIM** provides just-in-time privileged access to Azure resources and Azure AD with time-bound permissions, requiring explicit approval or MFA for activation.
