## Key Terms and Concepts

### DevSecOps
**DevSecOps** is an approach that integrates security practices within the DevOps process, making security a shared responsibility throughout the entire IT lifecycle.

### Shift Left Security
**Shift Left Security** is the practice of moving security testing and processes earlier in the development lifecycle, allowing issues to be found and fixed sooner when they are less costly to address.

### Security as Code
**Security as Code** is the practice of codifying security and policy decisions, making them programmable, version-controlled, and automatically enforceable throughout the software development lifecycle.

### Continuous Security Validation
**Continuous Security Validation** is the ongoing process of testing and verifying security controls to ensure they are functioning effectively, often through automated means.

### Security Debt
**Security Debt** is the accumulation of security issues that arise when security is neglected in favor of other priorities, similar to technical debt but focused on security vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

### Secure by Design
**Secure by Design** is an approach to software and hardware development that makes systems secure from the start, rather than adding security features later.

### Security Champions
**Security Champions** are team members embedded within development teams who have additional security knowledge and advocate for security practices within their teams.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes, allowing security controls to be embedded in infrastructure definitions.

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
**SAST** tools analyze source code for potential security vulnerabilities without executing the code, identifying issues early in development.

### DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
**DAST** tools test running applications by simulating attacks to identify vulnerabilities that might be exploited by attackers.

### SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
**SCA** tools identify and analyze open-source components in an application to detect known vulnerabilities and license compliance issues.

### IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing)
**IAST** combines elements of SAST and DAST by monitoring applications during testing to identify vulnerabilities with greater accuracy.

### RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection)
**RASP** is a security technology integrated into an application's runtime environment that can detect and block attacks in real-time.

### Threat Modeling
**Threat Modeling** is a structured process to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a system, allowing teams to implement appropriate mitigations.

### Security Posture
**Security Posture** is the overall security status of an organization's systems, network, and applications, as well as their ability to protect from and respond to security threats.
